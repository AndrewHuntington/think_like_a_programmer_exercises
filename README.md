# My Solutions to the Exercises in the Book *Think Like a Programmer*

This repository holds my answers to the exercises from the book *Think Like a Programmer*. I am working through this book to enhance my problem solving abilities. All code is my own.

I do not have any training in C++, so I am picking that up as I go along as well.
